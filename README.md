## Introduction

With hospital readmissions being a critical issue in the healthcare system, affecting both patient outcomes and healthcare expenses, our project seeks to apply advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques to address this challenge. Focusing on diabetic patients, we aim to predict readmission rates and uncover underlying factors contributing to these rates.

## Data Source

The dataset for this project comes from Kaggle's Fairlearn initiative, consisting of records from 130 hospitals and integrated health networks across various regions of the United States. This rich dataset provides comprehensive insights into patient demographics, hospital treatments, and outcomes over a decade.

## Research Questions

Our project centers around several key questions:
- Can we accurately predict hospital readmissions among diabetic patients using PySpark?
- What machine learning algorithms best predict readmissions, and how do their performances compare?
- Which factors are most influential in predicting readmissions, and how can these insights be applied in a clinical setting?

## Methodology

The project involves several key steps:
1. **Data Cleaning:** Addressing missing values and removing irrelevant features.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new variables to better capture the factors influencing readmissions.
3. **Modeling:** Exploring various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest, to predict readmissions.
4. **Analysis:** Evaluating model performance and identifying key predictive features.

## Results

Our analysis indicates that machine learning models can provide valuable predictions of hospital readmissions, with Logistic Regression and Random Forest models showing promising results. Feature importance analysis highlighted the critical role of specific variables, suggesting areas for clinical focus to reduce readmissions.

## Conclusions and Future Work

This project underscores the potential of data science in improving healthcare outcomes, particularly for diabetic patients at risk of readmission. Future directions include refining models through advanced techniques and integrating clinical expertise to enhance predictive accuracy.
